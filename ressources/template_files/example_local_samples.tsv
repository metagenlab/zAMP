# Minimal columns description. Should be removed before use !
# Table must be 'tsv' format, meaning tablute separated values.
#
# Columns description. All but the first one 'Sample' can be renamed.
#
## Sample:
### Samples identifier. Must contain only uniques values, that are NOT only numerical and
### which do not contains '-' or '.'. '_' are OK.
###
### Shoud match what is before '_L001_R*_001.fastq.gz' in the reads. If not, an 'OldSampleName' column matching the read
### names can be added in addition. An error will be thrown if not exactly one pair of reads in 'links/' matches each
### value contained in this columns.
### A'OldSampleName' column can be used to bypass this limitation. Then the content of this column will be used for
### matching, and the samples will be be renamed by the content of 'Sample' column.
#
#
## sample_label
### Samples description. Should be unique but can be adapted to best describe the samples in plots, tables etc...
#
#
## sample_group
### Describe group of samples which should be group togheter in generated output. For instance, will create on KRONA
### plot by value of this column (e.g. Patients IDs). We can also use this column to filter out unwanted values for
### plotting (e.g. QC samples).
#
#
## color_factor
### Description of the type of samples, for instance the source of the sample.
#
#
## seq_run
### Should be not numerique only. Describe the sequencing run. Used to generate run specific MultiQC reports. Used as
### well by DADA2 which generate an error profile for each run.
